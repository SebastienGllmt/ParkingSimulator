Parking Spot Simulator
========

This is a parking spot simulator inspired and an AbeBooks interview question.

Parkings are created and spots are allocated to them. You can then create cars of different types with different driver types.

Cars can be added to the parking and will be places in the optimal location available to their car/driver type.

This project has no concrete implementation of the parking simulator.

JUnit and Hamcrest are required to compile.
